# CoreDataDemo

I have tried to implement a demo , in which user can save First Name , Last name and Image of any user in Core Data and 
show that list in Table View . In which , I have provided the option to delete/update/edit any user details .
I have also added a check box in the table view cell so that any particular operation can carried out for that cell .
